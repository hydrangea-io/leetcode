/**
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes
 * with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices.
 * Return the reordered list.
 *
 * The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even,
 * and so on.
 *
 * Noe that the relative order inside both the even the odd
 * groups should remain as it was in the input.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
 * Output: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:  2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 -> 7
 * Output: 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4
