 * LeetCode 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
 * 
 * Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1,
 * which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over
 * one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend
 * to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back
 * to this vertex.
 * 
 * The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array eges, where
 * edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] means that there exists an edge connecting the
 * vertices a_i and b_i. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple,
 * where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise,
 * it does not have any apple.
